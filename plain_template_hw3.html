      <h1>Debate ramps up for Supreme Court term limits, greater diversity</h1>
      <h3><i>The U.S. Constitution grants Supreme Court justices lifelong appointments. That could change as public demand increases to put term limits in place.</i></h3>

    <p>Should there be term limits for Supreme Court justices? That’s currently up for debate within Congress and around the United States.</p>
    <p>The House of Representatives <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/03/democrats-introduce-bill-creating-18-year-supreme-court-term-limits-nominations-every-two-years/?sh=650a56fd2d30">introduced</a> the “Supreme Court Term Limits and Regular Appointments Act of 2020.” If passed, the bill would <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8424#:~:text=This%20bill%20establishes%20staggered%2C%2018,Court%20Justice%20every%20two%20years">limit</a> Supreme Court justices to 18-year terms and require the president to appoint a new Supreme Court justices every two years. According to the Constitution, the only <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/faq_general.aspx#:~:text=The%20Constitution%20states%20that%20Justices,removed%20from%20office%20by%20impeachment.">qualification</a> regarding the tenure for Supreme Court justices is that justices “shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.” This means justices can serve as long as they want unless they do something deemed worthy of being removed from office through impeachment, make the choice to retire from the bench, or die during their lifelong term.</p>
    <p>The push for Supreme Court term limits comes as better healthcare and standard of living has improved dramatically since the court was founded, leading to justice serving longer terms. Prior to the 1970s, justices <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/05/07/9173032-supreme-court-justices-termlimits/">served</a> about 15 years in office. Since then, the average has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-05-04/column-supreme-court-term-limit">risen</a> to nearly 26 years. Additionally, with the exception of Rhode Island, all other states <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-05-04/column-supreme-court-term-limit"> require</a> that their higher-ranked state justices either step down when they hit age 70 or are subject to a term limit imposed by that state. Out of all the high courts on the state or federal level in the United States (again, minus Rhode Island), the Supreme Court is the only court with no age cap or term limit in place.</p></div>

    <p>As seen in the chart above, the average length of tenure in office for a Supreme Court justice has risen gradually since the court was founded back in 1789. Recently, justices are serving longer terms, especially since 1950. Between 1950 and 2000, 8 justices have served at least 20 years in office. For context, only 17 justices had served at least 20 years between 1789 and 1950. Since 1975, every judge has served a minimum of 18 years on the bench, with three current Supreme Court justices serving a minimum of 29 years.</p> 
    <p>Tessa Murphy, <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/tessa-murphy">a professor at Syracuse University</a>, teaches history about the American Revolution and its aftermath for the United States. Professor Murphy says that the when the Founding Fathers were drafting the Constitution, the Supreme Court was seen as a really bold initiative and was seen as extremely controversial by some of those individuals.</p>
    <p>“The original Articles of Confederation never even mentioned anything about the Supreme Court or anything along those lines,” Professor Murphy said. “When the Founding Fathers created the Supreme Court under the new Constitution, they really didn’t really have the forethought for how the court would work.”</p>
    <p>Professor Murphy says it’s shocking that there’s almost no qualifications needed to serve on the Supreme Court. For example, Professor Murphy said that the Constitution requires no certain educational background or knowledge of law, something that was brought up <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/19/amy-coney-barrett-what-you-need-to-know-418378">multiple times</a> during the confirmation of now Justice Amy Comey Barrett.</p>
    <p>Professor Murphy says within the context of establishing term limits, she says a lifelong appointment back in the early-nineteenth century is completely different than a lifelong appointment in the modern-day.</p> 
    <p>Another subject of controversy for the Supreme Court involves its diversity, or more specifically, its’ historical lack of it.</p>

  <p>Professor Murphy says historically, the conversation around diversity within the Supreme Court has mainly been restricted to geography. Yet, even diversity among states is incredibly low. As of now, according to the chart, 19 states have never produced a Supreme Court justice, but 4 states (New York, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts) produced nearly 40% of all the justices who served on the Supreme Court. Most justices have been appointed from the Northeast or the South.</p> 
  <p>Historically, the Supreme Court has almost been entirely composed of white males. Not including the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/kbj/">recent confirmation</a> of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson (since she hasn’t served a day on the bench yet), <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/politics/supreme-court-justice-minorities-trnd/index.html">115 justices</a> have served on the bench and 108 of them were white men. Since 1789, only 7 justices that were either women or part of a minority community have served on the bench. Justices Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas, and Sonia Sotomayor are the only persons of color to ever serve on the Supreme Court.</p>

<div class="body4">
  <p>The push for term limits for the Supreme Court and greater diversity on the bench has really gained momentum after a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/another-leak-says-supreme-court-set-to-overturn-roe-v-wade.html"> Supreme Court draft leak</a> stated that the court plans to overturn Roe v. Wade, a ruling that gave Americans the right to choose whether they wanted to have an abortion or not. Now, the decision will be left entirely to the states. As of now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/abortion-laws-us.html">states</a> across the country are pushing for greater restrictions to limit access to abortion.</p>
  <p>Currently, any bills designed to impose term limits for the Supreme Court or to expand the court beyond 9 justices have been buried. Yet, Professor Murphy says the debate has only heated up and will be the subject of much conversation in the United States moving forward.</p>
  <p>“We know that almost every judge appointed to the Supreme Court was a white, property-owning male,” Professor Murphy said. “That trend has continued until very recently, and we have to come to grip with that reality.”</p>
